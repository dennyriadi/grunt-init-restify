# grunt-init-restify

> Scaffolds a new NodeJS REST API project using restify.

## Installation
If you haven't already done so, install [grunt-init][].

Once grunt-init is installed, place this template in your `~/.grunt-init/` directory. It's recommended that you use git to clone this template into that directory, as follows:

```
git clone hhttps://github.com/Findly-Inc/grunt-init-restify.git ~/.grunt-init/restify
```


## Usage

At the command-line, cd into an empty directory, run this command and follow the prompts.

```cd
grunt-init restify
```

_Note that this template will generate files in the current directory, so be sure to change to a new directory first if you don't want to overwrite existing files._
